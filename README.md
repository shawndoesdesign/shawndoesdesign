# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shawn!

Tech. Color domains. Yes.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests

I make stuff. Mainly websites and Discord Bots.

## âœ¨ Projects

[shawn.pink](https://shawn.pink) - This is my personal website where you probably found this Github page and my Twitter profile. :)

[Bubble Beats](https://github.com/shawndoesdesign/bubble-beats) - Music bot that you can self host. I used to host it, but it barely worked for me. You can fix it up if you want. Just change the Lavalink credentials and prefix if you wish.

## ðŸŒ± Currently in development

[Tidal](https://github.com/shawndoesdesign/tidal) - A bot based off the popular Fortnite creative map Tidal Tycoon where your goal is to collect all of the fish that you can. You will upgrade your rod, go to different areas, and try to catch all of the fish available in that area.
